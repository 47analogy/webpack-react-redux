# webpack-react-redux-react-router
A complete boilerplate for making apps with react, redux, react-router with the help of webpack. 

Contains: 

* a working example of a filterable table which you can play around with.
* ES6 - 7 Support with Babel
* Redux dev tools to help you keep track of the app's state
* hot module replacement support so you can change react modules without having to reload the browser
* a webpack production config so you can build the app and make it ready for production
* Sass support, just import your styles wherever you need them
* eslint to keep your js readable
* tests (coming soon, I swears)
* much more...


## Run the app

0. npm install
0. npm start

### If you rather install everything bypassing the package.json:

```
npm install --save express material-ui react react-dom react-redux react-router react-router-redux redux redux-logger redux-thunk isomorphic-fetch && npm install --save-dev autoprefixer babel-eslint babel-jscs babel-loader babel-polyfill babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react babel-preset-react-hmre babel-preset-stage-0 chai css-loader eslint eslint-plugin-react extract-text-webpack-plugin file-loader html-webpack-plugin jscs jsdom json-loader mocha mocha-jsdom node-sass postcss-loader react-addons-test-utils react-transform-hmr redux-devtools redux-devtools-dock-monitor redux-devtools-log-monitor rimraf sass-loader sinon sinon-chai stats-webpack-plugin style-loader url-loader webpack webpack-dev-middleware webpack-hot-middleware
